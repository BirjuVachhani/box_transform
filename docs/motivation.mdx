# Rect Resizer & Flutter Rect Resizer

We, [Saad Ardati](https://github.com/SwissCheese5) and [Birju Vachhani](https://github.com/BirjuVachhani), created Rect
Resizer and Flutter Rect Resizer to make it easy for anyone to create resizable and draggable rectangles in their Dart
and Flutter projects. We know how frustrating it can be to have to reimplement the same functionality multiple times.
That's why we created these packages after needing to implement resizable and draggable boxes over 3 separate times
in [Codelessly](https://codelessly.com/).

Our packages represent the culmination of our knowledge and experience in creating resizable and draggable boxes in
Flutter in a natural and accessible way. We're excited to share our work with others and hope that it can help save time
and simplify projects.

Rect Resizer is a pure-Dart base package that allows you to programmatically handle box resizing and dragging without
relying on Flutter. It provides highly flexible, programmatically resizable and draggable boxes that can be used in any
Dart project.

Flutter Rect Resizer is a Flutter package that builds on top of Rect Resizer, providing a state-friendly API for easily
implementing resizable and draggable boxes as Flutter widgets. With Flutter Rect Resizer, you can convert the pure-Dart
models to Flutter-relevant models and use its feature-complete API to quickly build your own resizable and draggable
boxes.

Whether you're working on a pure-Dart project or a Flutter project, we hope that Rect Resizer and Flutter Rect Resizer
can help you easily create the best possible version of a resizable and draggable box for your project.
