# Resizing

`TransformableBox` can be used to resize a widget by default. [Transformable Box](transformableBox) utilizes 
[Box Transform](boxTransform) to create a fully-featured Flutter implementation of the [Box Transform](boxTransform) API.

```dart title="Resizable widget"
  Stack(
    children: [
      TransformableBox(
        rect: rect,
        onChanged: (event) {
          setState(() {
            this.rect = event.rect;
            this.flip = event.flip;
          });
        },
        contentBuilder: {...},
      ),
    ],
  );
```

## ResolveResizeModeCallback

The `resolveResizeModeCallback` is a callback that is called whenever a resize operation is about to be performed on a
given [Transformable Box](transformableBox) The reason this is a callback is because it allows you to define the
resize behavior at the time of the resize operation. This is useful when you want to change the resize behavior
based on the state of the application.

The most common use case for this is keyboard shortcuts. We provide a `defaultResolveResizeModeCallback`
function that is used by default when resizing, and it's job is to listen to keyboard meta keys to change the
`ResizeMode`. It sets the `ResizeMode` to `ResizeMode.scale` when the `Shift` key is pressed, `ResizeMode.symmetric`
when the `Alt` key is pressed, and `ResizeMode.symmetricScale` when both the `Shift` and `Alt` keys are pressed.
`ResizeMode.freeform` is used otherwise.

You can use this callback to change the `ResizeMode` of the resize operation however you like and can provide a
fixed-behavior callback if desired.

`resolveResizeModeCallback: (ResizeMode mode) => ResizeMode.symmetric,`
