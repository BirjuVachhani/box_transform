# Resizing

`TransformableBox` can be used to resize a widget by default. [Transformable Box](transformableBox) utilizes 
[Box Transform](boxTransform) to create a fully-featured Flutter implementation of the [Box Transform](boxTransform) API.

```dart title="Resizable widget"
  Stack(
    children: [
      TransformableBox(
        rect: rect,
        flip: flip,
        onChanged: (event) {
          setState(() {
            this.rect = event.rect;
            this.flip = event.flip;
          });
        },
        contentBuilder: (context, rect, flip) => Transform.scale(
          scaleX: flip.isHorizontal ? -1 : 1, // flip horizontally
          scaleY: flip.isVertical ? -1 : 1, // flip vertically
          child: Image.asset( // your widget goes here.
            'assets/images/landscape.jpg',
            width: rect.width,
            height: rect.height,
            fit: BoxFit.fill,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    ],
  );
```

By default, resizing allows flipping the rect horizontally and vertically. Flipping is done by using the 
`Transform.scale` widget with negative scale values.

Resizing is freeform by default, meaning that the user can resize the box in any direction and in any size.

## ResolveResizeModeCallback

The `resolveResizeModeCallback` is a callback that is called whenever a resize operation is about to be performed on a
given [Transformable Box](transformableBox). This allows you to define the resize behavior at the time of the resize 
operation. This is useful when you want to change the resize behavior based on the state of the application.

The most common use case for this is keyboard shortcuts. A `defaultResolveResizeModeCallback` function is used by 
default when resizing, and it's job is to listen to keyboard meta keys to change the `ResizeMode`.

### Default Shortcut Keys for Resize Mode:

1. ResizeMode.freeform: Default mode. When no keys are pressed.
2. ResizeMode.scale: When `Shift` key is pressed.
3. ResizeMode.symmetric: When `Alt` key is pressed.
4. ResizeMode.symmetricScale: When both `Shift` and `Alt` keys are pressed.

See [ResizeModes](/resize_modes) page for more information on the different resize modes.

Override this default behavior by providing `resolveResizeModeCallback` in `TransformableBox` constructor to customize
resizing to your liking. This can also be used to allow only certain resize modes.

```dart title="Resizing with preseving aspect ratio"
  TransformableBox(
    rect: rect,
    flip: flip,
    resolveResizeModeCallback: () => ResizeMode.scale,
    onChanged: (event) {...},
    contentBuilder: (context, rect, flip) {...},
  );
```
This will resize the box such that the aspect ratio is preserved.

## Disable Flipping

Flipping can be disabled by setting the `flip` property to `Flip.none` and removing `Transform.scale` widget from
`contentBuilder` callback.

```dart title="Resizable widget without flipping"
  Stack(
    children: [
      TransformableBox(
        rect: rect,
        flip: Flip.none,
        flipEnabled: false,
        onChanged: (event) {
          setState(() {
            this.rect = event.rect;
            this.flip = event.flip;
          });
        },
        contentBuilder: (context, rect, flip) {
          return Image.asset( // your widget goes here.
            'assets/images/landscape.jpg',
            width: rect.width,
            height: rect.height,
            fit: BoxFit.fill,
          );
        },
      ),
    ],
  );
```
