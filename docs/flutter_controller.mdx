# Using a controller

The first method is to use the controller to control the box. This is the most flexible method and allows you to
control the transformable box externally with proper state management.

To create a controller, you can use the `TransformableBoxController` class. It mirrors a lot of the observed parameters
in the constructor excluding `contentBuilder`, `handleBuilder`, `handleGestureResponseDiameter` and
`handleRenderedDiameter` since these are accessibility and rendering specific features.

```dart
final TransformableBoxController controller = TransformableBoxController();
```

When using a controller, you should not use the following parameters: `box`, `flip`, `clampingBox`, `constraints`,
and `resolveResizeModeCallback`. These are all intrinsically managed by the controller.

Be sure to manage your `controller`'s lifecycle properly. You can use the `dispose` method to dispose of the controller
and release its resources.

```dart
class MySexyBox extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MySexyBoxState createState() => _MySexyBoxState();
}

class _MySexyBoxState extends State<MySexyBox> {
  final TransformableBoxController controller = TransformableBoxController(
    resolveResizeModeCallback: (ResizeMode mode) { /* ... */ }, // optional.
  );

  @override
  void dispose() {
    controller.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return TransformableBox(
      controller: controller,
      contentBuilder: (context, box) { /* ... */ },
    );
  }
}
```
