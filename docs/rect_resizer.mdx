# Rect Resizer

Rect Resizer is a pure-Dart base package that allows you to programmatically handle box resizing and dragging without
relying on Flutter. It provides highly flexible, programmatically resizable and draggable boxes that can be used in any
Dart project.

## Models

Rect Resizer defines several models to mimic that of Flutter's.

* The equivalent of `Size` is `Dimension`.
* The equivalent of `Offset` is `Vector2` from the `vector_math` package.
* The equivalent of `Rect` is `Box`.
* The equivalent of `BoxConstraints` is `Constraints`.

The APIs are very similar to Flutter's, so you should be able to pick it up quickly or be able to reference
Flutter's documentation for more information.

## Resizing

Resizing is done by using the static `resize` function from the `RectResizer` dart class.

It takes in an immutable `initialRect` as an input, as well as an initial `Vector2` position and a `Vector2` position
that represents the position the cursor moved from point A to point B. A delta is calculated internally
and used to resize the box.
