## Setting up project for development

This project uses melos to manage the monorepo. To get started, clone the repository and run the following commands:

1. Install melos. Make sure you have `.pub-cache/bin` in your path.

```bash
dart pub global activate melos
```

2. Setup the project with melos.

```bash
melos bootstrap
```

This will create dependency overrides for all the packages in the monorepo.

3. Run `pub get` with melos.

```bash
melos run deps
```

Now you can run the example app. See `melos.yaml` for more commands.
